# trafficLights

Simple traffic light animation using HTML, CSS and Javascript

A basic animation runs when the page loads to go through the red, amber, green sequence.

The page background will change colour when you hover on any of the lights. 

**Purpose:** I think I will just this on my phone to answer my wife when she asks me if I fancy a cuppa but otherwise, this can be used as a traffic light sign-posting system for student self-assessment.
